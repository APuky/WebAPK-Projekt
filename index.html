          <h2>The beginning.</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            It was not an easy beginning. <br />
            <br />
            F1 came up to become the premier single-seater racing championship
            in motorsports worldwide with its history paralleling the evolution
            of its technical regulations with time. Championships were not
            introduced immediately. For the most part of its beginning, up till
            1983 when the rising costs of competition made them unprofitable,
            most of these twenty-odd races continued to be non-championship
            ones. With a formula that was largely defined by engine capacity, in
            line with the pre-WWII regulations, the F1 gradually moves towards
            new regulations as late as in 1946, when the Turin Grand Prix held
            that year saw Achille Varzi winning the championship in an
            Alfa-Romeo158 Alfetta! <br />
            <br />
            The early years of the sport marked the end of the racing careers of
            pre-war heroes such as Manfred Von Brauchitsch, Tazio Nuvolari, and
            Rudolf Carracciola, and the rise of drivers like Juan Manuel Fangio
            and Alberto Ascari. While private cars also boomed, the formula was
            predominantly ruled by the major pre-war car manufactures like
            Ferrari, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, and Mercedes Benz. However, of the 20
            models that competed during the 1950s period, most were forced out
            by the exorbitant costs with only Ferrari continuing. In addition,
            the death toll was also gruesome, with the F1 losing 13 of the
            drivers in the very first decade.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            1952 and 1953 saw a lull with no entrants for the sport and in 1954
            F1 re-emerged with considerable technological advances in the cars
            that participated, especially Mercedes Benz, before it withdrew from
            all motor sports after the 1955 Le Mans disaster. Juan Manuel Fangio
            ruled the circuits in the 1950s, winning the drivers’ championship
            with five different manufacturers in 1951and then consecutively from
            1954-1957. Late 1950s also saw the introduction of Cooper’s
            rear-engined car that took the manufacturing spectrum by storm and
            in 1958 a constructors’ championship was introduced as a further
            incentive to teams.

            Niki Lauda suffered third-degree burns at the Nürburgring in 1976,
            and the hot toxic gases damaged his lungs. Initialy fine after
            getting out of the car, he later lapsed into a coma and was given
            the last rites in the hospital, but survived.

          <h2>The 1960s and 70s.</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            1958 also ushered in an era of British dominance in the sport with
            the win by Mike Hawthorn, followed by more British and Commonwealth
            drivers such as Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill, John Surtees, Jim
            Clark, Jack Brabham, and Denny Hulme winning the championships
            between 1962 and 1973 consecutively. <br />
            <br />
            National championships became the norm and this period saw the
            emergence and dominance of the revolutionary and iconic British
            Racing Green Lotus. Advertisings began to appear on the race cars by
            1968. With the advent of turbo-charged cars, speed and power became
            commonplace and the introduction of ground-effect aerodynamics made
            them slicker and faster with increased cornering speeds. Private
            entries took a complete knock-off with the approach of 1970s due to
            sky-rocketing expenses associated with the sport. <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            However, all through 1960s and 70s, safety continued to remain a
            concern. Death toll was high and the sport lost many champions.
            Lotus’ Jochen Rindt received the drivers’ championship title
            posthumously in 1970. Francois Cevert lost his life during a
            practice ahead of 1973 US Grand Prix with Stewart retiring on the
            eve of the championship after losing his close aide. 1975 brought
            more deaths with a car barging into the on-looking spectators
            killing four. In 1976, Niki Lauda suffered serious burns after a
            horrendous crash and 1978 saw the loss of Ronnie Peterson at Monza.
            <br />
            <br />
            The phase of legendary Lotus team, that had been the innovator of
            ground-breaking technologies and supreme performances, slowly ended
            with the end of 1978, which was their last championship-winning
            year. <br />
            But the early 1970s also saw the growth of the sport into a
            billion-dollar global business with Bernie Ecclestone rearranging
            the management of F1’s commercial rights and introducing the Brabham
            team in 1971. By 1978, he became the president of the Formula One
            Constructors’ Association (FOCA). <br />

          <h2>The F1 of 1980s.</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            1979 saw the formation of the Federation Internationale du Sport
            Automobile (FISA) and the ensuing clashes between the newly-formed
            FISA and FOCA over regulations and revenues that came to an uneasy
            truce with the 1981 Concorde Agreement. <br />
            <br />
            On the technology front, the 1980s witnessed the emergence of the
            electronic drivers’ aids (again a Lotus innovation!) and several
            restrictions came into place to combat the phenomenal power of cars.
            Turbos continued to dominate the circuits. <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            While 1980 was the year of dominance by Alan Jones and the Williams
            team, 1981 brought a new champion in Nelson Piquet who took the U.S
            Grand Prix title by one point. 1982 set a wedge between Ferrari’s
            Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi that ended with Villeneuve death
            at Zolder and Pironi’s fatal injuries that he sustained in practice
            for the German Grand Prix, two years later.
            <br />
            <br />
            1984 became a start-point of a period of dominance by McLaren with
            Lauda’s half-point win that year, followed by Alain Prost and Ayrton
            Senna winning the drivers’ title in seven out of eight years right
            up to 1988. 1989 ended with an absolute ban on turbochargers and
            with it the relationship between the two drivers deteriorated
            rapidly bringing an end to their era of being on the zenith. <br />

          <h2>The 1990s usher a new era.</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            By the early 1990s, the technology had a natural progression with
            semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control coming in. <br />
            <br />
            McLaren and Williams continued to rule the roost in the 1990s with
            the rivalry between their ace drivers, Prost and Senna continuing
            strong till 1993 when Prost retired and Senna died at Imola in 1994.
            Senna’s death marked a watershed year in the history of the sport
            with an increased consideration towards strengthening the safety
            standards and measures to slow the cars. The safety measure became
            so stringent that no driver has died at the wheel of an F1 car since
            then. <br />

          <h2>The 2000s.</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            While purists continued their “Technician & designers Vs Drivers”
            debates, teams like McLaren, Williams, Ferrari and Renault (formerly
            Benetton), continued to dominate the roost, winning every World
            Championship from 1984 right up to 2008.
            <br />
            <br />
            The sky-rocketing costs of F1 races further widened the chasm
            between these “big fours” and the smaller, independent racers.
            Consequently, 1990 to 2008 saw the entry and exit of over 28 teams.
            <br />
            <br />
            Michael Schumacher and Ferrari dominated the circuit between 1999
            and 2004, and the sport witnessed unprecedented consecutive wins of
            five drivers’ and six constructors’ championships. However, this
            period witnessed a drop in the viewing figures dropped and the
            sport’s future began to look gloomy, with a lot of behind-the-scenes
            politics and scandals. 2002 witnessed a ban on team orders after
            several incidents of manipulation of race results came to light,
            that further garnered negative publicity. No doubt, this period
            witnessed constant changes in the championship rules by the FIA in
            an effort to improve the on-track action and cut back costs.
            <br />
            <br />
            2000 onwards, manufacturer-owned teams such as Renault, Toyota,
            Honda, Ferrari and BMW, returned to dominate the scene and managed
            to negotiate a larger share and a greater say in the F1 management
            through the GPMA (Grand Prix Manufacturers Association). Today, F1
            continues its quest of expanding its reach with newer races in
            lucrative and emerging markets in the far and Middle East. <br />
