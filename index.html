            It was not an easy beginning. <br />
            <br />
            F1 came up to become the premier single-seater racing championship
            in motorsports worldwide with its history paralleling the evolution
            of its technical regulations with time. Championships were not
            introduced immediately. For the most part of its beginning, up till
            1983 when the rising costs of competition made them unprofitable,
            most of these twenty-odd races continued to be non-championship
            ones. With a formula that was largely defined by engine capacity, in
            line with the pre-WWII regulations, the F1 gradually moves towards
            new regulations as late as in 1946, when the Turin Grand Prix held
            that year saw Achille Varzi winning the championship in an
            Alfa-Romeo158 Alfetta! <br />
            <br />
            The early years of the sport marked the end of the racing careers of
            pre-war heroes such as Manfred Von Brauchitsch, Tazio Nuvolari, and
            Rudolf Carracciola, and the rise of drivers like Juan Manuel Fangio
            and Alberto Ascari. While private cars also boomed, the formula was
            predominantly ruled by the major pre-war car manufactures like
            Ferrari, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, and Mercedes Benz. However, of the 20
            models that competed during the 1950s period, most were forced out
            by the exorbitant costs with only Ferrari continuing. In addition,
            the death toll was also gruesome, with the F1 losing 13 of the
            drivers in the very first decade.
