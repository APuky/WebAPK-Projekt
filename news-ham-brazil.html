          Brazil saw an exciting wheel-to-wheel battle.

         Verstappen finished second with Valtteri Bottas third for Mercedes after a controversial, roller-coaster weekend in Brazil. "I don't remember another weekend like this," said Hamilton, his dream of a record eighth title back on with three races remaining. "It's quite overwhelming, to be honest." "This has been probably one of the best weekends, if not the best weekend, that I have experienced since ... probably in my whole career." <br />

         The Briton was fastest in Friday qualifying at Interlagos for Saturday's sprint that set Sunday's grid, and then demoted to the back of the fieldafter his car's rear wing failed a technical inspection. He went from 20th to fifth on Saturday, dropping back to 10th on Sunday's grid after an engine penalty but hungry for much more. The rest was history as the 36-year-old took his third win at Interlagos and set a record for victory in Brazil from the lowest grid position, beating Italian Giancarlo Fisichella's 2003 win from eighth.<br /><br />

           "Lewis, that's how you overcome a 20-place disqualification," Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told him over the radio after he took the chequered flag in front of a cheering crowd. "It was actually 25, but you're right," replied Hamilton. The win was Hamilton's sixth of the season and record-extending 101st of his career. <br />
          <br />

        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Red Bull's Sergio Perez finished fourth, pitting at the end for fresh tyres to set the fastest lap and deny Hamilton a precious bonus point. Mercedes moved 11 points clear of Red Bull in the constructors' standings. <br />
          <br />
          Bottas had started on pole but lost out to Verstappen into the first corner and then to Perez while Hamilton was already up to seventh. The reigning champion was third by lap five, with Bottas letting him through as expected. The 3.5 second gap to Perez was closed a lap later when the safety car was deployed after a clash between AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll left debris strewn across the track. Perez was then passed on lap 18, after a further virtual safety car period when the front wing on Mick Schumacher's Haas detached and left more debris. Then it was game on, with Hamilton pitting before Verstappen and cutting the gap. <br><br>
