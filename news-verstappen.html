          Max Verstappen wins 2021 Formula 1 world drivers’ title
        </h1>

          <p class="main-paragraph">
            Red Bull Racing Honda’s Max Verstappen has won his first Formula 1
            world drivers’ championship after finishing first at the very
            dramatic and eventful Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. With 26 points
            (including one for setting the fastest lap of the race) scored in
            the final round of the 2021 F1 season, the Dutch driver’s final
            tally of 395.5 points was enough for him to take the title ahead of
            close rival and seven-time world champion, Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1
            Team’s Lewis Hamilton, who had 387.5 points.

        <h2>First to win in a Honda-powered car since Senna</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          At 24 years and 73 days old when he won the championship, Verstappen
          is the fourth youngest F1 driver to do so, although he is the first to
          win in a Honda-powered car since Ayrton Senna accomplished the same 30
          years ago in 1991 with McLaren. Verstappen began his F1 career at the
          first free practice of the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix before starting
          his first F1 race with Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2015 – he was the
          youngest to do so for both. <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          In 2016, he would transfer over to the Red Bull team from the Spanish
          Grand Prix onwards, remaining there through to the start and end of
          the team’s partnership with Aston Martin, where he finished third in
          the drivers’ championship in 2019 and 2020. In both those seasons, as
          well as the recently concluded 2021, Red Bull cars were powered by
          Honda power units. <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Prior to the final and 22nd race of the 2021 season, Verstappen
          secured nine wins, including his home race at the Dutch Grand Prix,
          along with multiple second-place finishes, an 18th and 9th place
          finish as well as two retirements. Trading rounds with Hamilton on the
          regular, both drivers entered the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix levelled at
          369.5 points. <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Verstappen qualified first for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix but his start
          was less than desirable after giving up his position to Hamilton on
          the opening lap, with the British driver going over the run-off area.
          The title contenders would come in for their first pit stops, with
          Verstappen doing so on lap 13, followed by Hamilton a lap later.
          <br />
          <br />
          This left Sergio Perez in the lead, who did his best to hold off
          Hamilton on laps 20 to 21, with his teammate dubbing him a “legend.”
          Perez would then allow Verstappen to past him to continue his chase,
          although the top two spots remained the same until the safety car was
          brought out on lap 53 due to a Nicholas Latifi crash at turn 14.
