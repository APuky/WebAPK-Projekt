          Sergio Perez lived out a Formula 1 dream on Sunday with a home podium
          he called "very special" despite admitting his disappointment about
          failing to pass Lewis Hamilton late on, as Red Bull hailed the
          Mexican's form and the "best team spirit" he has helped instill.
        </h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          While Max Verstappen's win and Hamilton's defence prevented a perfect
          Mexican City GP for Perez, he still became the first Mexican driver to
          lead his home race and the first to secure a podium, finishing third
          in the end. One year on from being a free agent looking for a drive in
          F1, Perez was cheered on by 140,000 fans in a raucous atmosphere,
          while he was also joined in the post-race celebrations by his family.
          "It's definitely very special," Perez told Sky F1. "As a driver we
          always want more but today is a very special day for myself." <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          "I have pretty much everyone that has been with me since day one up
          there on the podium so that's something I enjoyed a lot. It's a very
          special day for my family, for my country, for all the fans and also
          for the team." Perez was hunting down Hamilton on fresh tyres but only
          got close enough for a mini-lunge at Turn 4 on the final lap - which
          was always too far back to be successful. "I obviously wanted more but
          it's a great result," said Perez. "I was giving my best but it was
          hopeless, I didn't have a single chance... if I had a small chance I
          would have gone for it." <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Nevertheless, Perez's podium was the latest in a string of encouraging
          results, securing three straight podiums for the first time in his
          lengthy career. Perez's improvement, getting to grips at the end of
          his first year in the Red Bull, is also a major boost for his team in
          their quest for the constructors' title - they are now just one point
          behind Mercedes - and the drivers' title, with Verstappen enjoying a
          19-point buffer to Hamilton with four races left. <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
          Red Bull boss Christian Horner praised Perez's work on and off the
          track. "He's found his form the last three or four races and that's
          just presenting us with so many more options," said Horner. <br />
          <br />
          "He's totally in tune with that, he's asking more questions from the
          car as well and I have to say, it's probably one of the best if not
          the best team spirit that we've had in this team." <br><br>
